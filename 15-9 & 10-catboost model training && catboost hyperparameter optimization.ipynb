    "## 3. CatBoost (Categorical Boosting):\n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "CatBoost is another advanced boosting algorithm specifically designed to handle categorical data efficiently. It is based on Gradient Boosting but incorporates specialized techniques to process categorical features, making it particularly useful for datasets with mixed data types (numerical + categorical).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How CatBoost Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handle Categorical Data Automatically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other algorithms (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM), CatBoost does not require manual one-hot encoding or other preprocessing for categorical features.\n",
    "It uses a unique encoding method called Ordered Target Statistics, which encodes categorical variables by estimating their effect on the target variable while avoiding data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start with Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other boosting methods, CatBoost starts with an initial prediction (e.g., the mean for regression or probabilities for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Train a Weak Learner:\n",
    "\n",
    "A weak learner (decision tree) is trained to minimize the loss function by predicting the residuals (errors) of the current model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Symmetric Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "CatBoost builds symmetric decision trees (same structure for all branches), which speeds up training and improves model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequentially Improve Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new tree is trained to correct the mistakes (residuals) of the previous trees. Predictions are updated iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combine Weak Learners:\n",
    "\n",
    "All the weak learners are combined into a single strong model, just like other gradient boosting algorithms."
